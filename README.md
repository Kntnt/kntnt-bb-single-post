## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why should I use this module?

Honestly, I don't know. You can accomplish what this module does, and much more, with the *Post Grid* module bundled with Beaver Builder.

### Is it working?

Yes. But of the eight layouts this module handle, CSS is missing for three (the two "beside content" and the "underneath" layouts).

### Will it ever be finnished or maintained?

Probably not. Feel free to contribute-

### Does it work with Beaver Builder 1?

Nope. Only Beaver Builder 2.

### Does it work with PHP 5 or PHP 7?

It is developed for PHP 7.

I have not taken PHP 5 into account when I coded, nor have I tested it with PHP 5.
